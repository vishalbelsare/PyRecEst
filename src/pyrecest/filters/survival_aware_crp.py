"""Survival-aware CRP-style association priors for multitarget tracking.

The classes in this module are deliberately small scoring utilities rather than
complete multi-object Bayes filters.  They expose a non-exchangeable,
CRP-inspired prior in which an existing track competes with birth and clutter
alternatives through survival, visibility, and measurement-compatibility
factors instead of through an exchangeable historical count alone.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mass : float, optional
        Effective historical evidence for the track.  This plays the role of the
        CRP table count, but the association prior can discount it through
        ``last_seen_steps`` and ``temporal_decay``.
    existence_probability : float, optional
        Predicted Bernoulli existence probability for the track.
    survival_probability : float, optional
        Probability that the track survives from the last prediction to the
        current association step.
    detection_probability : float, optional
        Detection probability conditioned on the target being visible.
    visibility_probability : float, optional
        Scene/sensor visibility probability.  This separates an actual missed
        target from a temporarily occluded target.
    kinematic_likelihood : float, optional
        Nonnegative kinematic compatibility between the measurement and the
        predicted track state, for example a Gaussian innovation likelihood or a
        gated score.
    appearance_likelihood : float, optional
        Nonnegative appearance or re-identification compatibility.
    last_seen_steps : int, optional
        Number of prediction/update steps since the target was last associated
        with a measurement.  Larger values reduce historical mass when the prior
        uses ``temporal_decay < 1``.
